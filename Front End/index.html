            <h3>About this program</h3>
            <p><em> Significant share of people is affected by disabilities and Widowâ€™s women in Bangladesh represent about a tenth of
                ever married women in the country. However, elderly people in Bangladesh also struggle to maintain a dependable
                income since finding employment is harder with age. Despite economic progress in Bangladesh, due to social stigma
                and patriarchal social norms, widows, disable people and elderly people tend to be highly vulnerable to poverty.
                Allowances for the financially insolvent disable, widowed or elderly people aim to provide poor disable, widowed
                women and old people with cash transfers to improve their socio-economic wellbeing. However, this web application
                we will made contain all information of allowances for disable, widow women and elderly people. They can log into
                the web application and see the amount of their allowance. It will also notify them (disable, elderly people and
                widow women) about their allowances and the date they can withdraw their allowance money.</em></p>
